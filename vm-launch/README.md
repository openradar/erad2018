## An Open Virtual Machine for Cross-Platform Weather Radar Science

The "Open Virtual Machine for Cross-Platform Weather Radar Science" was introduced by the `openradar` communiyt in 2015 (see Heistermann et al. 2015). The idea was to combine a number of weather radar software packages in a single environment: reliable, reproducible, scalable, and extendable.

Please see the [VM documentation](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) for more background, a quick start info, and more detailed instructions.
