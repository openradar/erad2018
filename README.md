## ERAD 2018 Short Course on Community Radar Software
The course will take place on July 1st 2018, right before the [ERAD 2018 conference](http://www.erad2018.nl/). We will introduce the participants to [community software packages](http://openradarscience.org) designed for radar data processing, including (but not limited to) [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/), [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/), and [wradlib](https://wradlib.org). 

The common ground for most of those tools is Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. For the course, we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) that contains all the required software, data, and course materials.

### Registration 
You need to register for the short course [here](https://www.erad2018.nl/registration/). The course fee is 75 EUR (coffee, lunch, room). Beware that the maximum number of participants is limited to 30.
