## A feel of scientific Python
In this session attendees will be given an introduction to Jupyter notebooks, Python and the scientific Python ecosystem. We will move through the material fairly fast but it will be available at [https://github.com/EVS-ATMOS/introductory_python](https://github.com/EVS-ATMOS/introductory_python) for users to review in thier own time. 

For this session, you should have the [open virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) up and running on your system. From within the home directory, please run

```
$ ./start_notebook.sh openradar
```

Then navigate with your host system's browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree](http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree), and open the directory `introductory_python` and start the notebook `A_feel_for_Scientific_Python.ipynb` from the list. We'll take it from there...
