## Hands on BALTRAD
The BALTRAD approach will be introduced by outlining the ways in which it is commonly deployed, and then the data representation model will be explained.

Following this introduction, course participants will get the chance to aquaint themselves with the look and feel of the BALTRAD Toolbox by running through a few notebooks that address data representation, quality control, compositing, and other features.

For this session, you should have the [open virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) up and running on your system.
The BALTRAD Jupyter notebooks are accessible on your VM instance by starting the Jupyter server:

```
$ ./start_notebook.sh
```

Then navigate with your host system's browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree](http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree), and open the directory `baltrad_short_course` and start the notebook `BALTRAD IO.ipynb` from the list. We'll take it from there...
