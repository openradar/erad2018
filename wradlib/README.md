## Hands on wradlib
In this session, we will get a feel of the wradlib package. The main entry point to wradlib is https://wradlib.org which will link you to wradlib's documentation, user groups, GitHub repositories, and more.

For this session, you should have the [open virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) up and running on your system. From within the home directory, please run

```
$ ./start_notebook.sh openradar
```

Then navigate with your host system's browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree, and open the directory `wradlib_notebooks` and start the notebook `wradlib_in_an_hour.ipynb` from the list. We'll take it from there...
