## Open Slot
The open slot is for you to follow your preferences. You have the VM up and running, and you already got a feel of the different packages. Do you want to explore BALTRAD, Py-ART, or wradlib further? Did you bring your own data that you'd like to work with? Do you want to exercise some basic Python? Or would you rather like to discuss other topics or software products?

Whatever it is, we'll do our best to support you in this remaining course hour.
